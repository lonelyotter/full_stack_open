# Exercise 1

For the hypothetical situation described, let us assume that the application is written in Java. Java is a popular programming language and has a thriving ecosystem with many tools available to handle continuous integration (CI) tasks.

One of the popular tools for linting Java code is Checkstyle. It can be used to enforce a consistent coding style, detect common programming errors, and provide suggestions for improvement. For testing, JUnit is a widely used framework for unit testing in Java. Additionally, tools like Selenium and Cucumber can be used for automated testing of user interfaces and behavior-driven development (BDD), respectively. For building, Apache Maven is a popular tool that can handle dependencies, build the project, and create executable files.

Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for setting up the CI for a Java application include Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. Travis CI is a cloud-based service that offers a free plan for open-source projects. CircleCI offers both cloud-based and self-hosted options and provides a free tier for small teams. GitLab CI/CD is a self-hosted solution that can be used for free with GitLab Community Edition.

Deciding whether to use a self-hosted or cloud-based environment for the CI setup depends on various factors. Self-hosting offers more control and security, but also requires more maintenance and resources. Cloud-based solutions are easier to set up and manage, but rely on third-party services and may have limited customization options. Factors like team size, budget, and data sensitivity should be considered when making this decision.

In conclusion, setting up a CI for a Java application can be achieved using various tools and services available in the ecosystem. Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions include Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. The choice between self-hosting and cloud-based environments depends on several factors and should be made based on the team's specific needs and circumstances.
